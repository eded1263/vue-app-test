# Vue Application Test

Congratulations on making your way to here! On this step, we will be taking a look at your coding skills. So, without further do, let's talk about the test!

## The test

### You will be making a... **Pokedex**!

To accomplish this, you will need to use [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/), to get the necessary data about the pokemons.

### Details

  - The application needs to allow the user to search for a specific Pokémon.
  - It should list Pokémons, and allow the user to get more information about them.
  - When displaying a single pokemon, the app needs to show: 
    - Name
    - Pokémon Type
    - Both normal and shiny sprites, but the user should be able to choose between them.
    - The stats from the Pokémon
  - The design is totally up to you! We are not asking for the greatest Pokédex of all time, so don't worry, we are looking for a developer, not a designer. But here is a tip: try something clean and with the colors from the game!

### Technologies

Ok, so now that you know what to do, lets talk about how you will make it!

You need to use:
  - Vue
  - Vuex
  - Typescript
  - Scss

### Getting started

To get started, just fork this repository and start coding! Whenever you finish it, just send me an email at _edilson@quicktech.no_ and i'll take a look at your code.

I wish you the best of luck!
